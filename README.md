# Basic Synthesizer

This is an experiment with synthesizing audio.

Currently, the synthesizer contains a single oscillator that can output one of five waveforms at a time: sine, square, saw, triangle and noise.

A signal will be generated and played upon a key press. Pressing keys in the bottom row of your keyboard will generate a C note at increasing pitches from Z - M.
